[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml-inline-transitions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml-inline-transitions)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tbranyen/diffhtml-inline-transitions/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/tbranyen/diffhtml-inline-transitions?branch=master)

Tiny module to support binding/unbinding declarative diffHTML transition hooks.

#### Install

``` sh
npm install diffhtml-inline-transitions
```

#### About transition hooks

diffHTML allows developers to globally define transitions that can react to
changes in the DOM and optionally prevent renders until a returned Promise
completes. This is ideal for animations and monitoring when things happen.  You
can read more on them [on the diffHTML GitHub
page](https://github.com/tbranyen/diffhtml#user-content-add-a-transition-state-callback).

##### Basic jQuery fadeOut example

> Each element will fade out for a second before being removed from the page.

``` js
diff.addTransitionState('detached', el => $(el).fadeOut(1000).promise());
```


While it is very easy to set up global state handlers, it becomes complicated
once you try to filter down to the eact element you want to match. You can
envision the complications of many transitions:

``` js
document.addTransitionState('detached', el => {
  if (el.matches('.shopping-cart li')) {
    // Do one thing.
  }
  else if (/* imagine even more */) {

  }
  else {
    // The default thing.
  }
});
```

Since the handlers are global and expensive to run you typically want to only
register one at a time. This builds up the if/else logic. The best way to fix
this is to expose the state callbacks as an inline attribute => prop hook. So
basically you set the property `attached` to a function and it registers it for
you.

Internally it will only create a single transition hook and will batch and
optimize your scoped placement. **There are two notable API signature
differences:**

- First, it adds the element you defined the transition on as the first argument
  to the transition callback. This way you can track the relationship between
  where the transition was mounted and any child elements that may trigger it.

- Second, it sets the transition callback context (the `this`) to be the
  current element being affected, which makes it more useful.

#### API

- Subscribe to attribute changes

  ``` js
  const unsubscribe = inlineTransitions(diff);
  ```
- Unsubscribe from attribute changes:

  ``` js
  unsubscribe();
  ```

#### Full example

Apply to an element by passing the function to the associated state name:

``` js
import $ from 'jquery';
import * as diff from 'diffhtml';
import inlineTransitions from 'diffhtml-inline-transitions';

const { innerHTML, html } = diff;

// Enable the monitoring of attributes for changes.
inlineTransitions(diff);

// Use jQuery to return a promise and fade in the body and paragraph.
function fadeIn() {
  return $(this).fadeOut(0).fadeIn(1000).promise();
}

innerHTML(document.body, html`<body attached=${fadeIn}>
  <p>Watch me fade in slowly!</p>
</body>`);
```
